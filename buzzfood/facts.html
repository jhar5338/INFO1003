                                <p class="flow-text">What is a balanced diet? To put it simply, it is a diet which contains foods that provide you with the protein, carbohydrates, fats, vitamins and minerals that you need to function on a day to day basis. The main groups of foods recommended for a healthy diet are fruits, vegetables, grains, legumes, nuts, dairy, oils and lean protein. Together these make up the food triangle:<br><br>   <img class="responsive-img" src="images/triangle.png"></p><p class="flow-text">So what’s wrong with the ‘junk’ food that most people eat on a regular basis? They have many problems, including excess amounts of sugar (which are simple carbohydrates), excess amounts of fat, high levels of salt, low amounts of fiber, a distinct lack of vitamins and minerals and a range of artificial chemicals in them. This means they can lead to weight gain, vitamin/mineral deficiencies and a variety of medical complications if eaten in excess.</p></div>

                                <p class="flow-text">Most people have heard the word calorie, but what IS a calorie? Forgoing the scientific description, it is simply a measure of the amount of energy that is in the food you eat. Your body requires a certain amount of calories per day (if you want to know how many you need, check out Buzzfood’s calorie calculator) and a variety of foods should supply you with those calories. <br><br>On average most people require roughly 2000 calories a day, though this varies greatly with body type. <br><br>
So why is this so important? It’s because junk food often has very high amounts of calories and doesn’t fill you up, thus leading to you eating much more than your recommended daily caloric intake over the course of a day. This can cause weight gain and in the long term, health problems.<br><br>
                                    Here are some examples:<br></p>

<p class="flow-text">Remember that the average amount of calories people should eat per day is around 2000. We can see that as we move from healthy to unhealthy foods, the amount of calories drastically increases. A reasonably sized fast food meal can contain up to 5 times as many calories as a healthy meal and can account for the majority of your daily caloric intake. And that is just ONE meal. Most people have 2-3 other meals throughout the day, each of those containing large amount of calories.<br><br>
It’s not hard to see why fast food can lead to people eating far more calories per day then they are supposed to be. So how can you prevent this? The best way is to know how many calories you need per day (use a calorie calculator like the one on this site) and be aware of how many calories are in the food that you’re eating. Almost all food you buy in packages has a nutritional table on it that tells you the amount of calories per serving and many food chains are now including the amount of calories in each meal on their website or their menu.<br><br>
Note – in Australia, the measurement is often in kilojoules (kJ) rather than calories. Both of them are the same concept, representing how much energy is in the food. However 1 calorie equals 4.2 kilojoules, so you have to be aware of this. Taking our 2000 calorie recommended daily intake from before, this means the average daily intake is around 8400kJ.</p>

                                Eating too much junk food can cause serious health problems. These center around weight gain and excess salt. Being overweight greatly raises your risk of cardiovascular disease and high blood pressure, which puts you at an increased risk of heart attacks and heart failure. These may result in the need for serious surgery too. Another major complication is strokes, with studies showing that overweight people can have up to a 65% greater risk of stroke.<br><br>
There are plenty of other health problems tied to being overweight, including an increased risk of colon cancer, osteoarthritis (joint problems), gallstones, sleep apnea, depression and of course, type 2 diabetes.<br><br>
Many people eat junk food because it’s cheap and convenient. However, the medical conditions listed above can cost you thousands of dollars in treatment and they can be very inconvenient to your activity. So make sure you think about your future when it comes to your diet.
